# RUST

## Description

Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

> If you give someone a `.rb, .py, or .js` file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively)
> ...  
> ...but in those languages, you only need one command to compile and run your program.

**Everything is a trade-off in language design.**

## Examples

- 01_hello_world - Most basic program possible.
- 02_hello_cargo - Package management.
